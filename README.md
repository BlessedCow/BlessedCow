### Hi

I'm a Python developer with a passion for building automated solutions to streamline business processes. My focus is on utilizing OCR technology to automate Citrix billing software, by using libraries like PyTesseract, PyTorch, and PyAutoGUI to achieve this.

Most of my repos are private, because they are either school-related or still not thought out completely and could also have some sensitive information. I don't want anyone to see what I've written just yet.
I plan on making more of my repos public as I start to flesh out my programs.

I occasionally write and publish other things than just python like Google Apps Scripts and Java.
I'm currently in college taking classes for Python and C++ so I have plans on doing some fun stuff with those.

I'm still kinda new when it comes to Github - let alone programming. For the longest time I was all about computer hardware and electronic engineering, so programming is all very new to me.
