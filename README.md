Hey.

I'm a Python developer with a passion for building automated solutions to streamline business processes. My focus is on utilizing OCR technology to automate Citrix billing software, by using libraries like PyTesseract, PyTorch, and PyAutoGUI to achieve this.

Most of my repos are private, because they are school-related and I don't want anyone to see that nonsense that I've written. 

I occasionally write and publish other things other than python.

I'm also currently working on reverse engineering a certain TEMS device, that pairs with your smartphone, in order to "reset" the charges.
