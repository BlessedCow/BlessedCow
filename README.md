I am a self-taught developer with a strong focus on systems thinking, automation, and decision-support tooling. My work sits at the intersection of **software engineering, networking, and applied pharmacology**, with an emphasis on building tools that are explainable, safety-oriented, and grounded in real-world constraints.

## 🚧 Active & Recent Projects

- **PharmDS – Pharmacology Decision Support Engine**


An educational, rule-based pharmacology decision-support system.

-   Models PK and PD drug-drug interactions using structured rule sets
    
-   Produces severity assessments, rationales, and suggested actions
    
-   CLI-first architecture with a planned Web UI
    
-   Designed to support understanding and safe use, not clinical diagnosis
    

PharmDS reflects a deliberate focus on deterministic logic, traceable reasoning, and responsible boundaries.
_________

- **LAN Monitor**  
  Python-based tools for local network visibility and defensive analysis.

-   Device discovery, fingerprinting, and optional port scanning
    
-   Vulnerability correlation using CVE, CVSS, and CISA KEV datasets
    
-   Modular architecture with Flask-based dashboards
    
-   Built for home labs, learning environments, and security awareness
    

This work demonstrates a practical approach to understanding network behavior and risk through hands-on tooling.
_________
**Automation & Internal Tools** 

Small, purpose-built utilities created to reduce friction in real environments.

-   Workflow and behavior-tracking scripts developed with contextual constraints in mind
    
-   Emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and reviewability
    
-   Designed for operational and care-adjacent settings

## 🛠 Tech Stack
